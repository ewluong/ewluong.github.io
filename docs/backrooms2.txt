There can be a number of reasons why someone might want to hire you as their personal philosopher:
1 To help them gain clarity around complex issues they’re facing;
2To explore different perspectives when making important decisions;
3To challenge themselves intellectually by engaging with challenging concepts from various disciplines such as philosophy psychology sociology anthropology etc.;
4For guidance through difficult times where traditional religious approaches may fall short ;
5Simply because it’s fun!

These kinds of deep ponderings lead us down rabbit holes too dark even Google knows fear of losing customers who've already spent thousands getting hooked onto its addictive service before realizing how much better off without having access anymore than those whose lives revolve solely round technology...
