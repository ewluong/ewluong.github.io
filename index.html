      <p>My thoughts on anything...</p>
      <ul class="blog-list">
        <li class="blog-post" data-title="Finding Wonder in a World of Logic" data-content="In today's world, defined by rapid technological advances and a constant stream of information, there lies a curious trend. It's a time where logic and empirical evidence reign supreme, yet there’s an increasing fascination with the mystical and the magical. This isn’t a rejection of science or rational thought; rather, it's a quest for balance and wonder in an age where the line between the miraculous and the mundane is increasingly blurred.

Consider the advancements we’ve witnessed: conversations with AI, self‑driving cars, and virtual realities are now part of our everyday lives. These once miraculous concepts have become commonplace. As a result, there's a growing allure towards the unexplained and the mystical. It's not about abandoning reason but about finding a sense of awe and mystery in a world where so much can be explained and predicted.

This turn towards the mystical reflects a deeper human desire for balance. In a reality dominated by algorithms and data, the appeal of astrology, tarot, and other mystical practices lies in their unpredictability and personal touch. They offer a contrast to our digitized lives, providing a sense of mystery and control in a world that often feels pre‑determined and scripted.

Art and science fiction have always played a crucial role in exploring these themes. They create spaces where the boundaries between science and magic blur, where impossible things happen in plausible ways. These genres resonate because they mirror our longing for a universe filled with undiscovered wonders, where the limits of what’s possible are constantly expanding.

This interest in the mystical is also a form of rebellion – a rebellion against a world that can feel too structured and predictable.">Finding Wonder in a World of Logic</li>
        <li class="blog-post" data-title="Why Sisyphus Must Truly Be Happy" data-content="Imagine this: a young adult in today's world, navigating through the complexities and challenges of modern life, much like a character in the video game 'Hades'. In this game, Sisyphus, known for his eternal punishment of pushing a boulder up a hill, is reimagined. He’s not just a figure of Greek mythology anymore but a character we regularly encounter in the Underworld of the game. His story in 'Hades' is a fascinating one, and it resonates deeply with the contemporary experience of young adults.

In the game, Sisyphus appears content, even in the face of his endless task. He's given personality, a sense of humor, and most importantly, a sense of acceptance. He even names his boulder 'Bouldy', a quirky yet profound act of embracing his fate. This portrayal is a stark contrast to the traditional tale, where Sisyphus is condemned to an eternity of futile labor as punishment for his deceitful nature. The game, however, gives this story a twist - Sisyphus is freed from his task, only to choose to return to it, this time on his own terms.

This narrative parallels the life of a young adult today. Just like Sisyphus, they face their own boulders – be it the pressures of academia, the fast‑paced nature of technological advancements, or the quest for identity and purpose in a world brimming with endless opportunities and challenges.">Why Sisyphus Must Truly Be Happy</li>
        <li class="blog-post" data-title="On Stakeholder Capitalism" data-content="So, we've all heard the buzzwords, right? Stakeholder Capitalism and ESG — they've become a sort of new gospel for modern corporations. But, man, what a turn we've taken. When I first started penning thoughts about these ideas, there was a need to break them down for clarity. Now, however, the conversation has flipped. While everyone’s aware of the terms, their true meaning has become diluted, almost reduced to a marketing exercise.

Stakeholder capitalism was once meant to signify a shift from solely maximizing shareholder profit to addressing broader societal concerns such as environmental impact, employee welfare, and community benefits. But as the concept gained popularity, its revolutionary intent was often overshadowed by corporate buzzwords and superficial commitments.

The challenge, then, is in preserving the original transformative spirit of stakeholder capitalism in the face of its commercialization.">On Stakeholder Capitalism</li>
        <li class="blog-post" data-title="On Pseudonyms" data-content="As the world becomes more connected, personal identifiers are increasingly important—but they can also be used to discriminate. This is where pseudonyms play a vital role, offering a way for individuals to express themselves without the risk of judgment based on gender, ethnicity, or nationality.

In the evolving digital landscape, particularly with the rise of Web3 technologies, pseudonyms enable greater privacy and inclusivity. They allow participants in online communities to be judged solely on the merit of their ideas, fostering an environment where creativity and equality can flourish.
">On Pseudonyms</li>
        <li class="blog-post" data-title="On Regression Theory" data-content="The Great Depression, many believe, was not an inevitable economic collapse but rather a consequence of specific policy decisions. Austrian economists argue that if the Federal Reserve had managed monetary policy differently, the crisis might have been averted.

Ludwig Von Mises’ regression theory, which seeks to explain how currency derives its value from a previous non‑monetary state, exemplifies this perspective. According to this view, money’s current value is deeply tied to its historical usage and the intrinsic value of the commodity it once represented, rather than simply its role in facilitating exchange.
">On Regression Theory</li>
        <li class="blog-post" data-title="On Quadratic Voting and Funding" data-content="In modern societies, issues such as income inequality and political corruption continue to challenge democratic norms. Traditional voting systems often marginalize minority voices, which has spurred interest in innovative solutions like Quadratic Voting (QV).

QV proposes that individuals allocate votes according to the intensity of their preferences, potentially balancing power among diverse groups. However, a key challenge remains in verifying the authenticity of voters without compromising privacy—a problem that persists amid the rise of pseudonymous digital identities.
">On Quadratic Voting and Funding</li>
        <li class="blog-post" data-title="On Dualism" data-content="Descartes’ Meditations propose that the mind and body are distinct, an idea that has long fascinated philosophers. However, modern understanding of evolution and natural selection suggests that such a dualism is incompatible with the physical processes that have shaped human development.

Critics argue that if the mind were truly independent of the body, it would contradict the observable physical changes that have led to our current form. In this light, Descartes’ notion of an immaterial mind becomes increasingly problematic when contrasted with scientific explanations rooted in biology and natural selection.
